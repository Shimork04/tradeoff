# Traders Management System - README

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Traders Management System, a full-stack application developed for the hackathon to assist exporters of small consignments in finding and booking available spaces in partially filled cargo containers. This platform connects exporters with shipping companies or container owners, facilitating efficient and cost-effective shipping solutions.

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication and Profiles**
   - Registration and login functionality for exporters and shipping companies.
   - User profiles with detailed information, including contact details, business information, and preferences.

2. **Container Space Listing**
   - Shipping companies can list available spaces in partially filled cargo containers.
   - Listings include container size, available space, destination, departure date, and price.

3. **Search and Booking**
   - Exporters can search for available container spaces based on destination, departure date, and container size.
   - Booking functionality with booking confirmations.

4. **Shipment Tracking**
   - Real-time shipment tracking from booking to delivery.
   - Status updates and notifications for users.

5. **Payment Integration**
   - Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for handling booking fees and transactions.
   - Invoicing, receipts, and payment confirmations.

## Technology Stack

- **GraphQL**: For efficient data querying and manipulation.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and ensuring a consistent development and deployment environment.
- **MongoDB**: For database management, providing a scalable and flexible NoSQL database.
- **Next.js**: For building the frontend of the application with React and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Payload CMS**: For managing content and providing a flexible backend solution.
